# AUC-Course-Registration-Optimizer

This is a small personal project of mine I developed in response to the registration problems I usually face during course registration for AUC. The script has two modes:
  1- Registration Mode: Sends a request to the server at exactly 12 AM to reserve prespecified courses.
  2- Wait Till Dropped Mode: continuously scrapes AUC Banner until a course (from a pre-specified list) is dropped and automatically reserves it.
  
usage: download the script and edit the values for the variables in the beginning
